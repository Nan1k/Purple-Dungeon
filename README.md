Purple Dungeon - Game
My first project on Github and coursework presented on an online course on the Python programming language.
The essence of the game is quite simple, you control a figure inside the maze. Your goal is to collect 2 coins. For ease of movement, your path is drawn with a line, and there are also 2 red portals that return your figure to the beginning
